## Algorithm for Gesture Detection Using Image Processing with Python 

Abstract —: Gesture is the most primitive technique for conversation amongst human being. Today in the time of current day innovation gesture recognition affects the world differently, from the physically challenged individuals to robotic manage to virtual fact conditions.  In this paper, a deep convolution neural network is proposed to immediately classify hand gestures in pictures without any segmentation or detection stage that could discard the irrelevant not-hand area.
Keywords — : Hand gesture recognition, Human Computer interaction interface etc.

# I.	INTRODUCTION


Hand gesture recognition system received great attention in the recent few years because of its manifoldness applications and the ability to interact with machine efficiently through human computer interaction. In this paper a survey of recent hand gesture recognition systems is presented. Key issues of hand gesture recognition system are presented with challenges of gesture system. Review methods of recent postures and gestures recognition system presented as well. Summary of research results of hand gesture methods, databases, and comparison between main gesture recognition phases are also given.

# II.	METHODOLOGY/EXPERIMENTAL


Hand gesture recognition system is used as human computer interaction medium as well as for paralyzed persons so it’s useful current technology. To achieve the goal of system several tools and technologies have been used. The study of tools and technologies and the previous technologies used are studied and researched thoroughly.

# a)	Open cv: 

 Open CV is the set of open source computer vision library and computer vision is the way of teaching intelligence to machine and making them see just like human. Opencv is an image processing library which was created by intel and later supported by willow garage and now maintained by idseez. It’s available for mac ,windows and linux. It works in C,C++,Python. It is open source and free as well as easy to use and install. OpenCV helps the deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Torch/PyTorch and Caffe. 

# b)	Computer vision:-

 Computer vision is the way of teaching intelligence to the machines and making them see the images or videos and extract the data from them just like humans. The goal of computer vision is to write computer programs that can interpret images or videos i.e. the programs can take images as an input and give the descriptive information about the image. This whole process occurs in several stages as first the image is taken as the imput and then processing of image occurs.

# c)	Deep learning:-

 Deep learning is the machine learning technique which learns directly from the data. The data can be in any digital form as images, text ,sound as well as videos. Deep learning works on the heavy set of data. It basically classifies the type of information and then gives it as an output. There are many layers in the deep learning to make it efficient and powerful. There are mainly two layers in the algorithm used in deep learning. The first one is feature extraction layer which extract the features based on convolutional neural network and the one is classification layer which classifies the image and gives the information as the result.

# d)	Convolutional neural network:-

 In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep neural networks, which deals with the set of data to extract information about that data. Like images, sounds or videos etc. can be used in the CNN for the data extraction. There are mainly three things in CNN. First one is local receptive field and then shared weight and biases and the last one is activation and pooling. In CNN, first the neural networks are trained using a heavy set of data so that the CNN can extract the feature of given input. When the input is given, first image preprocessing is done then the feature extraction occurs on the basis of set of data stored and then the classification of data is done and output is shown as the result.

# e)	Inception v3:-

Transfer learning is a machine learning approach which makes use of a pre-trained neural network. There are mainly 2 phases in this method. First one is Feature extraction phase which uses convolutional neural network and another one is Classification phase with fully-connected network. For example, the image recognition model recognized as Inception-v3 consists of two parts: classification layer and softmax layers
